================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Data Leakage through Accessors
Issue: Getter methods can be a source of unintended data leakage. If sensitive data is handled, direct access might lead to potential security risks.
Solution: Ensure sensitive fields are properly secured with access control or data obfuscation.

Vulnerability: Immutable Objects
Issue: Providing a getter for a mutable object can lead to the object's modification by other parts of the code, potentially altering its state unexpectedly.
Solution: Ensure that mutable objects are returned as read-only if directly exposed through getters or return copies of internal mutable objects.

Vulnerability: Inconsistent Naming Convention
Issue: Adhering to a naming convention is essential for maintaining clean and understandable code.
Solution: Ensure your field names and method names adhere to a consistent naming convention. In the Java world, the camel case style is commonly used.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method returns the correct name

 Details:  
    TestName: testReturnedNameIsCorrect
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the 'getName' method by confirming it returns the correct name of the entity. 

  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an object and set its name as "TestObject".
    Act: Invoke the 'getName' method of this object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned name is "TestObject".

  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the 'getName' method correctly retrieves the name that was originally set. This is important for ensuring the entities in the persistence layer are correctly identifiable.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method handles null value

 Details:  
    TestName: testNameIsNull
    Description: This test is designed to check how the 'getName' method responds to null input, which could occur if a name has not been set for an entity.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an object without setting a name (which should then default to null).
    Act: Invoke the 'getName' method of this object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned name is null.

  Validation: 
    The assertion confirms the method's ability to handle null input, thus ensuring that users won't face NullPointerException when dealing with unnamed entities.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method can handle empty strings

 Details:  
    TestName: testNameIsEmpty
    Description: This test is to check if the 'getName' method can handle an entity name that is an empty string, as this could be a valid scenario in certain applications.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an object and set its name as an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the 'getName' method of this object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned name is an empty string.

  Validation: 
    The assertion checks the method's ability to handle empty strings as expected, thus maintaining accurate information about an entity in specific scenarios where no name has been provided.
