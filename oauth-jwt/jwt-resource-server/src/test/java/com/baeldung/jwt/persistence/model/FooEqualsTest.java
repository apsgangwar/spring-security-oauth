================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Type-casting vulnerability
Issue: The unsafe type casting of the 'obj' parameter to 'Foo' type without checking instance of before casting can lead to ClassCastException.
Solution: Always use the instanceof keyword before casting to ensure that the object can be casted to the required type safely.

Vulnerability: Null pointer vulnerability
Issue: The id or name can be null for an object. If we directly access methods, such as .equals(), without checking for null, it may lead to NullPointerException.
Solution: Always perform null check before accessing methods or attributes of an object.

Vulnerability: Information leakage
Issue: Your equals method might be giving away information that can be used by an attacker, even if you're not intending it. This 'timing attack' can be used to infer information based on how long it takes for the equals method to respond.
Solution: Make sure that your equals method takes a constant amount of time, regardless of the input. You can do this by always comparing all fields, rather than returning false as soon as one non-matching field is found.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Same Object Comparison

  Details:  
    TestName: sameObjectComparison
    Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies when the same object is being compared. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary for this test as we are comparing the same instance.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on an instance of Foo, passing itself as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the method returns true. 
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when it is comparing an object with itself, in line with the reflexivity property of the equals contract. This is crucial to ensuring logic consistency throughout the application. 

  Scenario 2: Comparison with null

  Details:  
    TestName: nullComparison
    Description: This test checks if the equals method appropriately identifies when it's comparing to null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary for this test as we are comparing the instance with null.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on an instance of Foo, passing null as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion confirms that the equals method behaves correctly when compared to null, an essential aspect of the equals contract to prevent NullPointException.

  Scenario 3: Different Class Comparison

  Details:  
    TestName: differentClassComparison
    Description: This test aims to validate if the equals method returns false when comparing objects of different classes.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of a class other than Foo.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on an instance of Foo, passing the different class instance as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion ensures that the equals method correctly identifies that objects of different classes cannot be equal. This is significant in maintaining type safety and logical consistency in application behavior.

  Scenario 4: Equal Objects Comparison

  Details:  
    TestName: equalObjectComparison
    Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies matching Foo objects based on their known properties.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two separate instances of Foo with the same id and name
    Act: Invoke the equals method on one instance of Foo, passing the copy as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the method returns true.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies the correct identification of equivalent Foo instances using the equals method based on their properties. This is crucial in checking object equality and consistency inside data structures.

  Scenario 5: NonEqual Objects Comparison

  Details:  
    TestName: nonEqualObjectComparison
    Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly differentiates non-matching Foo objects based on their properties.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two separate instances of Foo with different id or name
    Act: Invoke the equals method on one instance of Foo, passing the other as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly differentiates instances of Foo based on their properties. Different instances should not be seen as equivalent, ensuring correct object management and business logic application.
