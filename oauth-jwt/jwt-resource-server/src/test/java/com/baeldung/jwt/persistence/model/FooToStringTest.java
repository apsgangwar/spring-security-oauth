================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The toString() method might expose information about the object's internals which can be information leakage.
Solution: Be careful what information you put within toString() methods. It's always better to exclude sensitive information like passwords, IDs etc.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The toString() method is often used for debugging purposes and developers might forget to remove or comment them before going into production.
Solution: Always make sure to clean debug code before pushing to production. Use logging frameworks for debug messages as they can be managed by administrators more easily.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If these toString() methods are used in URLs for GET requests, they could expose sensitive data.
Solution: Only use POST methods for sensitive data and encrypt all sensitive data in transit.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test to ensure the toString method returns the correct string representation of the 'Foo' object.

Details:  
  TestName: testValidFooToString.
  Description: This test is meant to check the correct functionality of the toString method when it's invoked in the context of the Foo class instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the Foo class with predefined 'id' & 'name' values.
  Act: Invoke the 'toString' method of the created Foo object.
  Assert: Assert that the string representation matches the expected format.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly converts the 'Foo' object into its string representation.
  The significance of this test is to ensure that the toString method behaves as expected, which is essential for debugging and logging purposes.

Scenario 2: Test the toString method when name property is null.

Details:  
  TestName: testNullNameFooToString.
  Description: This test is meant to validate how the toString method handles the situation when the 'name' field is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the Foo class with an 'id' and null 'name'.
  Act: Invoke the 'toString' method of the created Foo object.
  Assert: Assert that the string representation matches the expected format when 'name' is null.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly handles null 'name' and does not throw null pointer exception.
  The significance of this test is to ensure that 'toString' method appropriately handles edge cases where 'name' field is null.

Scenario 3: Test to ensure the toString method when id property is null.

Details:  
  TestName: testNullIdFooToString.
  Description: This test is meant to validate how the toString method handles the situation when the 'id' field is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the Foo class with null 'id' and a 'name'.
  Act: Invoke the 'toString' method of the created Foo object.
  Assert: Assert that the string representation matches the expected format when 'id' is null.
Validation: 
  This assertion is to verify that the toString method correctly handles null 'id' and does not throw null pointer exception.
  The significance of this test is to ensure that 'toString' method appropriately handles edge cases where 'id' field is null.

Scenario 4: Test to ensure the toString method when both properties are null.

Details:  
  TestName: testNullPropertiesFooToString.
  Description: This test is meant to validate how the toString method deals with a situation where both 'id' and 'name' properties are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the Foo class with null 'id' and null 'name'.
  Act: Invoke the 'toString' method of the created Foo object.
  Assert: Assert that the string representation matches the expected format when both 'id' and 'name' are null.
Validation: 
  This assertion is to verify that the toString method correctly handles null properties and does not throw a null pointer exception.
  The significance of the test is to cover an edge case where both object properties are null thus assessing the robustness of the 'toString' method.
