================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The default configuration for the mapping '/api/foos/**' might allow more access rights than intended.
Solution: Make sure to define all your mapping methods to specify what HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) each method should respond to as a best-practice and avoid potential HTTP Verb Tampering attacks. Limit roles for each methods if possible. Always stick to 'Principle of Least Privilege'. 

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: The code does not seem to have built-in methods to protect against CSRF exploits, where attackers trick authenticated users to perform certain actions.
Solution: Make use of anti-CSRF tokens and secure headers to mitigate this issue. Most of security frameworks provide built-in support for generating and validating CSRF tokens. Here is how you could do it in Spring: Use the .csrf().disable() method as a temporary workaround, however it's highly recommended to use some sort of CSRF protection which is built into Spring Security.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: Access controls are not properly enforced when a user attempts to access certain resources directly.
Solution: Entity permissions should be checked every time a request is made by an authenticated user to ensure that the account making the request is permitted to access the specific resource. Routinely audit your paths, check role and scope in depth manner.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')
Issue: The configuration does not seem to limit the number of requests a client can make, allowing for potential Denial-of-Service attacks to overload the server.
Solution: Impose certain restrictions on a per-user basis to prevent one user from overwhelming your system with requests. Use Spring Security's .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS) and also limit your server's usage using proper configurations to mitigate this issue.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verify HTTP GET Request with Valid Authority 
Details:  
    TestName: verifyHttpGetRequestWithValidAuthority
    Description: Test is meant to validate and simulate HTTP GET request having valid authority 'SCOPE_read' to the "/user/info" and "/api/foos/**" endpoints.
    Execution: 
      Arrange: Mock HttpSecurity object with '/user/info' and '/api/foos/**' as GET request URLs and 'SCOPE_read' as a valid authority.
      Act: Invoke the target 'configure()' method with the mock HttpSecurity object. 
      Assert: Assert that the request is authorized for '/user/info' and '/api/foos/**' URLs with authority 'SCOPE_read'. 
    Validation: 
      Assert that the configuration is valid for GET request to URLs '/user/info' and '/api/foos/**' with 'SCOPE_read' authority. This test checks the correct handling of GET requests.

Scenario 2: Verify HTTP POST Request with Valid Authority
Details:  
    TestName: verifyHttpPostRequestWithValidAuthority
    Description: Test is meant to validate and simulate HTTP POST request having valid authority 'SCOPE_write' to the "/api/foos" endpoint.
    Execution: 
      Arrange: Mock HttpSecurity object with '/api/foos' as POST request URLs and 'SCOPE_write' as the authority.
      Act: Invoke the target 'configure()' method with the mock HttpSecurity object. 
      Assert: Assert that POST request is authorized for '/api/foos' URL with authority 'SCOPE_write'. 
    Validation: 
      Assert that the configuration is valid for POST request to URL '/api/foos' with 'SCOPE_write' authority. This test checks the correct handling of POST requests.

Scenario 3: Verify All Other HTTP Requests with Authentication
Details:  
    TestName: verifyOtherHttpRequestWithAuthentication
    Description: This test is meant to validate and simulate other HTTP requests (other than GET and POST defined above), that they require to be authenticated.
    Execution: 
      Arrange: Mock HttpSecurity object to carry out any request.
      Act: Invoke the target 'configure()' method with mocked HttpSecurity object. 
      Assert: Assert that any other request requires authentication. 
    Validation: 
      Assert if the configuration requires authentication for requests that are not explicitly defined. This ensures adherence to the security principle of denying by default unless explicitly granted.
  
Scenario 4:  Verify JWT Configuration for oauth2ResourceServer
Details:
    TestName: verifyJwtConfiguration
    Description: This test is meant to check the correctness of JWT configuration for oauth2ResourceServer.
    Execution:
      Arrange: Mock HttpSecurity object carrying authorization requests.
      Act: Invoke the 'configure()' method with the mock HttpSecurity object. 
      Assert: Assert that '@oauth2ResourceServer().jwt()' is properly called and configured.
    Validation:
      Assert that the JWT configuration for oauth2ResourceServer is correct. This test checks the logic for JWT token implementation in the oauth2ResourceServer configuration.
