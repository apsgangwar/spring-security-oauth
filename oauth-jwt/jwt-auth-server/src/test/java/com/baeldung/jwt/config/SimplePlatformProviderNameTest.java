================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
Issue: The code lacks the use of proper restrictions for XML External Entity Reference which opens doors to XXE attacks. This can lead to disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, and server-side request forgery.
Solution: Ensure proper limitations and restrictions are placed on XML External Entity Reference.

Vulnerability: CWE-1021: Improper Restriction of Directories or Files
Issue: The import 'java.io.File' class is a potential risk as it opens up the possibility of arbitrary file manipulation with possible directory traversal attacks.
Solution: Ensure explicit checks are added where access to the file system is required. Refrain from using this class if possible, opting for a more secure alternative to handle file manipulation.

Vulnerability: JWT Vulnerabilities
Issue: The system seems to use JSON Web Tokens (JWT). If not properly implemented, it might be subject to various attacks such as brute forcing the secret key, intercepting the token, and others.
Solution: Ensure JWT is securely implemented. Secret keys should be long and complex, they should not be leaked or left in source code. Users should be regularly authenticated.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to ensure that the method returns the correct string value

  Details:
    TestName: testMethodReturnCorrectValue
    Description: This test verifies that the method `name()` correctly returns the string "jwt-auth-server" as the server name.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement required for this test as the method does not require parameters or use any external data.
    Act: Invoke the method `name()`.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the return value is equal to the string "jwt-auth-server".
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to validate that the hardcoded return value of the method is correctly returned. It's vital to test this to ensure that the server name is correctly given when asked.

Scenario 2: Test to ensure that the returned value is of the correct type

  Details:
    TestName: testReturnValueType
    Description: This test verifies that the method `name()` correctly returns a value of the string type.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement required for this test as the method does not require parameters or use any external data.
    Act: Invoke the method `name()`.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the return value is of String type.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to check if the return value of the method is correctly implemented as a String. This is important to validate to avoid possible type mismatches in further processing of the returned value.

Unfortunately, given that the method does not take any parameters and only returns a fixed value, there are no input edge cases, error handling, or alternative scenarios to test.
