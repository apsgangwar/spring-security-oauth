================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: The application appears to be downloading or using third-party code, libraries or other resources such as `org.keycloak.common.util.ResteasyProvider`, `org.jboss.resteasy.spi.ResteasyProviderFactory`. This is a security risk if the integrity of the downloaded resources is not validated.
Solution: Ensure that any code, libraries, or resources downloaded by the application are validated against known hashes or signatures to confirm their integrity. A secure process could include the use of digital signatures or creating a hash of the downloaded content and comparing against a known good hash.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The `pushDefaultContextObject(Class type, Object instance)` function receives and processes input without validating or sanitizing them. This could lead to various vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks.
Solution: Make sure to perform thorough input validation and sanitization before processing them. In the specific case of handling classes and objects, consider checking that the class type belongs to a strict, white-listed set of expected classes, and validating the state of the object if possible.

Vulnerability: CWE-566: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
Issue: The method ‘put(type, instance)’ receives user-controlled input for a key to a sensitive resource, which could enable attackers to bypass authorization measures and access sensitive data or functionalities.
Solution: Do not involve user input in decisions regarding resource access without properly ensuring the user's privileges. If possible, implement an abstraction layer for access control, or a mapping that links user input to resource keys or identifiers, without relying directly on user input.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test Successful Push Default Context Object
  
  Details:
    TestName: testPushDefaultContextSuccess
    Description: This test checks whether an instance is correctly pushed as a default context object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create mock objects for Dispatcher, ResteasyProviderFactory and DefaultContextObjects. Also create an instance of a class type that can be pushed.
    Act: Call the method pushDefaultContextObject with the class type and the instance created.
    Assert: Verify the instance was successfully pushed by checking it exists as a default context object.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks if the instance was successfully pushed as a default context object. This is important as the application might depend on these context objects for managing different services.
  
  Scenario 2: Test Pushing Default Context Object with Null Value

  Details:
    TestName: testPushDefaultContextWithNull
    Description: This test aims to check the behavior of the method when a null instance is pushed as a default context object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create mock objects for Dispatcher, ResteasyProviderFactory and DefaultContextObjects.
    Act: Call the method pushDefaultContextObject with class type and null instance.
    Assert: Verify the null instance was not added as a default context object or an appropriate error is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion checks to see if handling of null instances is done appropriately without causing crashes. Proper null handling is important for the stability of the application.

  Scenario 3: Test Pushing Default Context Object of Same Class Type Multiple Times

  Details:
    TestName: testPushSameDefaultContextMultipleTimes
    Description: This test verifies the behavior when the same class type instance is pushed multiple times as a default context object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create mock objects for Dispatcher, ResteasyProviderFactory and DefaultContextObjects. Also create multiple instances of the similar class type.
    Act: Call the method pushDefaultContextObject with the similar class type instances multiple times.
    Assert: Verify whether the most recently added instance overwrites the previous ones or if an appropriate error is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks if the code handles situations where the same class type instances are pushed multiple times. In a normal workflow, newest instances should overwrite older ones or an appropriate error should be thrown. This is critical for the application to manage its resources effectively.

  Scenario 4: Test Pushing Different Class Type Instances

  Details:
    TestName: testPushDifferentClassTypeInstances
    Description: This test verifies the method's ability to handle different class type instances pushed as default context objects without causing conflicts.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create mock objects for Dispatcher, ResteasyProviderFactory and DefaultContextObjects. Also create instances of different class types.
    Act: Call the method pushDefaultContextObject multiple times with different class type instances.
    Assert: Verify that all instances were added to the context without conflicts.
  Validation: 
    The validation checks whether different class type instances can coexist in the default context objects without issues. This is critical in a microservices architecture where various services, each represented by a different class type, need to be handled.
