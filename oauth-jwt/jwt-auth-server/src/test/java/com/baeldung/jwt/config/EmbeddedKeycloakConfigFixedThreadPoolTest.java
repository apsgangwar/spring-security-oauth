Scenario 1: Testing fixedThreadPool method for the default behavior. 

Details:  
  TestName: checkFixedThreadPoolDefaultBehaviour.
  Description: This test will check whether the fixedThreadPool method returns an executor service with a fixed thread pool size of 5.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup or mocks are required in this case as the provided method works independently.
  Act: Call the fixedThreadPool method.
  Assert: Validate the returned ExecutorService has the expected fixed thread pool size of 5.
Validation: 
  The assertion is meant to ensure that the ExecutorService returned has a pool size of 5. This is important because the fixedThreadPool method should create a thread pool of the size specified, which in this case is 5.

Scenario 2: Testing the behavior of fixedThreadPool method when the ExecutorService is overloaded.

Details:  
  TestName: checkFixedThreadPoolWhenOverloaded.
  Description: This test will check the behavior of the ExecutorService returned by the fixedThreadPool method when it's being overloaded with more tasks than its pool size.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup data, mocks, or test doubles are required.
  Act: Call the fixedThreadPool method and assign more tasks to the ExecutorService than its thread pool size.
  Assert: Ensure that no exceptions are thrown, and tasks are executed sequentially.
Validation: 
  The assertion is intended to verify that the ExecutorService returned by the fixedThreadPool method is managing the tasks correctly even when overloaded. This is significant because it tests the robustness of the method under high load conditions.

Scenario 3: Testing the state of the ExecutorService returned by fixedThreadPool method after shutdown.

Details:  
  TestName: checkFixedThreadPoolAfterShutdown.
  Description: This test will check the state of ExecutorService after it is shut down by calling the shutdown method.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup data, mocks, or test doubles are required.
  Act: Invoke the fixedThreadPool method, then call the shutdown method on the returned ExecutorService.
  Assert: Ensure that the ExecutorService is indeed shut down by checking its isShutdown() method.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the ExecutorService returned by the fixedThreadPool method can be successfully shut down. This test is important to ensure that resources used by the ExecutorService can be properly cleared when not in use.
