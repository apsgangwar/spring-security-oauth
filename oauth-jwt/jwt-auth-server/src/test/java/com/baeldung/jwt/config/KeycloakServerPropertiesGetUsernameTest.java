""" 
  Scenario 1: Test to check if correct username is returned

Details:  
    TestName: testCorrectUsernameReturned
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'getUsername' method is returning the correct 'username' which was previously set. It is important to ensure the method is retrieving the correct data.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set a known username to the user.
    Act: Invoke the 'getUsername' method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the username returned by the method matches the username that was initially set.
Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'getUsername' method is accurately retrieving and returning the username which has been previously stored. This is essential in maintaining the data integrity of the user.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if null is returned when username is not set.

Details:  
    TestName: testNullReturnedWhenUsernameNotSet
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'getUsername' method is returning null when the username is not set. It helps to identify if the method is correctly handling this scenario.
Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the username is not set.
    Act: Invoke the 'getUsername' method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the method returns null.
Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'getUsername' method is capable of handling cases where the username has not been set, by returning null. This aspect is significant to avoid unexpected behavior during program execution.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if empty string is returned when username is set as empty.

Details:  
    TestName: testEmptyStringReturnWhenUsernameSetAsEmpty
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'getUsername' method is returning an empty string "" when the username is set as such. It helps to identify if the method is correctly handling this edge case.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set the username as an empty string "".
    Act: Invoke the 'getUsername' method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the method is returning an empty string "".
Validation: 
    The assertion intends to verify that 'getUsername' method correctly returns an empty string when the username is set as such. This aspect is significant, as returning the exact value even if it is empty, ensures the accurate functionality of the program.
