================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring (CWE-779)
Issue: In case of any malfunctioning or suspicious activity, a lack of appropriate logging mechanism can make it difficult to spot misbehaviors and take corrective action.
Solution: Implement logging mechanisms for important activities such as login attempts, administration activities, etc.

Vulnerability: Improper Access Control (CWE-284)
Issue: Any user can access the 'getUsername()' method. If it contains sensitive information, it has the potential to be mishandled.
Solution: Ensure proper access control is enforced. This can be performed by secure design patterns, for example restricting the scope to an acceptable level, or using Java's built-in Access Control API.

Vulnerability: Information Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: The method 'getUsername()' could expose sensitive information if not handled properly.
Solution: Ensure that any data returned by 'getUsername()' is appropriately sanitized and devoid of any sensitive data before being returned.

"""
  Scenario 1: Validate when GetUsername method returns a non-null username

  Details:  
    TestName: getNonEmptyUsername.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the getUsername method is returning the correct non-empty username. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as getUsername does not require any parameters.
    Act: Invoke getUsername method.
    Assert: Verify that the returned result is not null or empty.
  Validation: 
    This will verify that the getUsername method is functioning correctly by returning a non-empty username.


  Scenario 2: Validate when GetUsername method returns an empty username

  Details:  
    TestName: getEmptyUsername.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the getUsername method can handle the situation where the username is empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set username as empty.
    Act: Invoke getUsername method.
    Assert: Verify that the returned result is an empty string.
  Validation: 
    This will verify that getUsername is able to handle the situation where the username is an empty string and returns an empty string as expected.


  Scenario 3: Check when the username is a long string

  Details:  
    TestName: handleLongUsername.
    Description: This test checks the capability of getUsername method to handle a long string username.
  Execution:
       Arrange: Define a username that is a large string. 
       Act: Call the getUsername() method.
       Assert: Verify that the result is equal to the large username string that was defined.
  Validation: 
       This test case checks the ability of getUsername to support large string inputs and ensures program stability under extreme conditions.


  Scenario 4: Validate when GetUsername method returns null value

  Details:  
    TestName: handleNullUsername.
    Description: This test is designed to examine how getUsername method handles a username value that is set to null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set username to null value.
    Act: Invoke getUsername method.
    Assert: Validate that the returned result is null.
  Validation: 
    By running this test case we can verify if the getUsername method supports null username and doesn't throw an exception, instead returns a null value as expected.
