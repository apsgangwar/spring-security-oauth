================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Access Control (CWE-284)
Issue: The code does not perform any access control checks before pushing a context object into ResteasyContext. If the object contains sensitive data, an attacker can potentially access it.
Solution: You should check if the current user has necessary permissions to access the particular object before pushing it to the context. Use JWT or OAuth token for verifying user credentials.

Vulnerability: Injection (CWE-74)
Issue: The type parameter in the pushContext method could be vulnerable to injection attacks, as it is passed directly to ResteasyContext.pushContext without any sanitization.
Solution: Validate or sanitize inputs before passing them to methods. Verify the Class type instance against a whitelist of allowed types, to ensure that it does not contain any unexpected or harmful values.

Vulnerability: Information Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: The use of standard error output in Java might accidentally expos√© sensitive information, especially when exceptions occur, making it vulnerable to information exposure.
Solution: Avoid writing sensitive information to error logs. Instead, use a secure logging library designed to mask sensitive information or do not log sensitive information at all.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Context Push Test

Details:  
  TestName: testPushContextWithValidParameters
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the pushContext method when given valid type and instance as parameters. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the type as a valid Class type and instance as an object of the same type.
  Act: Invoke the pushContext method with the valid type and instance. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the factory context has been populated with the given type-instance pair.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the pushContext method successfully pushes the given type and instance into the context when provided valid input. The success of this test ensures the basic functionality of the method is correct, important for application behavior.

Scenario 2: Context Push Test with Null Parameters 

Details:  
  TestName: testPushContextWithNullParameters
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the pushContext method when given null in place of type and/or instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Place null values as parameters for the method.
  Act: Invoke the pushContext method with null values.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method throws an appropriate exception.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the pushContext method properly handles null input and throws the appropriate exception when it encounters null values as parameters. This handles an edge case where improper or non-existent input might cause failure.

Scenario 3 : Context Push Test with Already Existing Context

Details:
  TestName: testPushContextWithExistingContext
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the pushContext method when there already exists a context with the same type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a context with a specific type. Then, create another context with the same type.
  Act: Invoke the pushContext method with the second context.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check whether the new context replacing the already existing context.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly replacing the old context if new context with the same type is added. This handles an edge case where multiple context with same type is used. This is significant in maintaining the integrity and uniqueness of context in the application.

Scenario 4: Context Push Test with Invalid Type

Details:
    TestName: testPushContextWithInvalidType
    Description: This test is meant to check how the pushContext method handles an instance that does not belong to the mentioned type.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance that doesn't belong to the mentioned type.
    Act: Invoke the pushContext method with the wrong type and instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method throws the appropriate exception or error.
Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the pushContext method properly handles instances that don't belong to the mentioned class type. This helps in maintaining clean and uncorrupted data in the context.
