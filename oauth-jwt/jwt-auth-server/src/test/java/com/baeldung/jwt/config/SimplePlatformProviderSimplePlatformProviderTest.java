================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-2: Environment Variables Exposure
Issue: The code uses 'System.getProperties()', which might expose sensitive information stored in system properties to Keycloak's configuration.
Solution: Instead of using 'System.getProperties()', which returns all system properties, only pass necessary properties using 'System.getProperty()'. Apply property encryption if sensitive data such as credentials need to be passed.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: File object creation and operations are generally associated with high risk due to Path Traversal attacks and File Disclosure, especially without performing sanitation and validation on the filenames.
Solution: Without the direct usage of the File object in the provided code it is hard to give direct advice, but always ensure to implement strong access controls and proper path sanitation to make sure file operations are secure.

Vulnerability: CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
Issue: If sensitive data like database credentials, API keys, etc. are stored in system properties or in properties file without encryption, they might be exposed facing the risk of being accessed by malicious actors.
Solution: Sensitive data should be encrypted using a strong encryption algorithm and managed securely, for example by using dedicated secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test the correct configuration of profile with system properties

Details:  
  TestName: testProfileConfigurationWithSystemProperties
  Description: This test is meant to check if the Profile is correctly configured with system properties using the PropertiesProfileConfigResolver method. The target scenario is the standard use-case where PropertiesProfileConfigResolver is provided with system properties.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the tested method has no input parameters.
    Act: Invoke the SimplePlatformProvider constructor,
    Assert: Check whether the Profile has been configured with system properties.
  Validation: 
    The assertion is verifying that the Profile has been correctly set with system properties. If successful, it proves that the system properties have been correctly applied to the Profile which is crucial for the correct functioning of the application.

Scenario 2: Test the correct configuration of profile with a properties file

Details:  
  TestName: testProfileConfigurationWithPropertiesFile
  Description: This test is meant to validate whether the Profile is correctly configured with a properties file using the PropertiesFileProfileConfigResolver method. The target scenario is the standard use-case where PropertiesFileProfileConfigResolver is used.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as PropertiesFileProfileConfigResolver doesn't require any input parameters.
    Act: Invoke the SimplePlatformProvider constructor,
    Assert: Check whether the Profile has been configured with properties file.
  Validation: 
    This assertion is verifying whether the Profile has been correctly set with parameters from a properties file. If successful, it assures that the properties file has been correctly applied to the Profile which is crucial for specific application setups or environments.

Scenario 3: Test the correct instantiation of SimplePlatformProvider

Details:  
  TestName: testSimplePlatformProviderInstantiation
  Description: This test is meant to validate whether the SimplePlatformProvider can be correctly constructed. The target scenario is the proper instantiation of SimplePlatformProvider class.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement necessary as there are no input parameters.
    Act: Instantiate the SimplePlatformProvider class.
    Assert: Check whether the SimplePlatformProvider object is not null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion is verifying that the constructor successfully creates an object of the SimplePlatformProvider class. If successful, it proves that the construction of SimplePlatformProvider works as intended which is prerequisite for correct application setup.
