================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The use of RuntimeException to catch and propagate errors which carries the risk of exposing sensitive system information to users.
Solution: Avoid using generic exceptions like RuntimeException. Instead, use specific exceptions and implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate the input it gets from the servletRequest, which may lead to issues if the input is malformed or malicious in nature.
Solution: Ensure to include input validation checks for the `servletRequest` and `servletResponse` objects before using them in the code block.

Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: If the exception 'e' contains user input, it may carry the risk of log injection.
Solution: Do not log the raw exception 'e'.Ensure output is properly neutralized for logs.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: Any error information should not go to the client side. It may leak the application's internal details which can be a potential security loophole.
Solution: Handle exceptions and error messages in a way that they are caught and logged on server side, but the client receives a generic error page.

"""
Scenario 1: Standard path with correct servletRequest and servletResponse

Details: 
  TestName: testDoFilterWithValidParameters
  Description: This test is meant to check the filter method is properly executed when valid servletRequest, servletResponse, and filterChain parameters are provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the ServletRequest, ServletResponse, and FilterChain objects. 
    Act: Invoke the doFilter method with the mocked ServletRequest, ServletResponse, and FilterChain.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure no exceptions were thrown during the execution.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the filter method successfully executed without throwing any exceptions when provided with valid parameters. 
    It validates that the method handles valid inputs gracefully without causing any disrupt in the application flow.

Scenario 2: Exception thrown from filterChain.doFilter method

Details: 
  TestName: testDoFilterWithExceptionThrownFromFilterMethod
  Description: This test ensures that the code gracefully handles the situation when an exception is thrown from the filterChain.doFilter method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the ServletRequest, ServletResponse, and FilterChain objects. Set up the mock to throw an exception when filterChain.doFilter is invoked.
    Act: Invoke the doFilter method with the mocked objects.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that a RuntimeException is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to ensure that a RuntimeException is thrown if an exception occurs while executing filterChain.doFilter. 
    This is essential for maintaining the robustness of the application and triggering the appropriate error handling steps when an exception occurs in a chained method.

Scenario 3: Cast Exception when casting ServletRequest to HttpServletRequest

Details: 
  TestName: testDoFilterWithCastError
  Description: This test checks if the code is properly handling the scenario where a mismatch in type causes a Class Cast Exception.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the ServletRequest, ServletResponse, and FilterChain objects such that ServletRequest is not an instance of HttpServletRequest.
    Act: Invoke the doFilter method with the mocked objects.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that a ClassCastException is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks the robustness of the method against incorrect input types. Test verifies that an appropriate error is thrown when problem occurs 
    during casting which enables critical type safety measures.
