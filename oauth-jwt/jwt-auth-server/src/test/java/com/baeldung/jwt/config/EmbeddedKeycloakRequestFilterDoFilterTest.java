================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Error Handling Information Leak
Issue: In the given code, exceptions are caught and a new RuntimeException is thrown, potentially leaking sensitive information contained in the exception to the end-user.
Solution: Monitor and log exceptions but do not directly expose exception messages to the user. Instead, return a generic error message.

Vulnerability: CWE-079: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: Servlets and JSPs might be susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if request data, including headers and cookies, are not handled properly.
Solution: Encode data output with a method suitable for the context, like for HTML context use HTML entity encoding.

Vulnerability: CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
Issue: The code directly sets the character encoding of the request, without validation, to UTF-8. If the original encoding was different, this could result in improper handling of the request.
Solution: Always validate the request's character encoding before setting a new one.

Vulnerability: CWE-315: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
Issue: If clientConnection object contains sensitive data, the current code might expose it in cleartext, posing a risk of data leak.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive information is encrypted both at rest and in transit.

"""
Scenario 1: Normal case where the method executes without exceptions
Details:
  TestName: testNormalCase
  Description: This test verifies that the method executes as expected when all conditions are normal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock ServletRequest, ServletResponse, and FilterChain.
    Act: Invoke doFilter method with mock objects.
    Assert: Verify that servletRequest.setCharacterEncoding, createConnection, filter, and filterChain.doFilter are all called once.
  Validation:
    We want to make sure that under normal conditions, all the steps of the doFilter method are executed properly. This verifies the basic functionality of our method.

Scenario 2: Case where the encoding is unsupported
Details:
  TestName: testUnsupportedEncodingException
  Description: This test verifies that the method handles UnsupportedEncodingException properly, which is thrown if the chosen encoding is not supported.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock ServletRequest, ServletResponse, and FilterChain. Force an UnsupportedEncodingException when servletRequest.setCharacterEncoding method is called.
    Act: Invoke doFilter method with mock objects.
    Assert: Assert that the UnsupportedEncodingException is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the doFilter method correctly handles the UnsupportedEncodingException and propagates it at the upper level. It helps ensure that our method is robust in the face of errors.

Scenario 3: Case where an exception is thrown during filterChain.doFilter
Details:
  TestName: testExceptionDuringFilterChainDoFilter
  Description: This test verifies that the method handles Exceptions correctly, which are thrown from filterChain.doFilter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock ServletRequest, ServletResponse, and FilterChain. Force an Exception when filterChain.doFilter method is called.
    Act: Invoke doFilter method with mock objects.
    Assert: Assert that the RuntimeException is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the doFilter method correctly catches and handles the Exception thrown from filterChain.doFilter by wrapping it into a RuntimeException. It helps ensure that our method is robust in the face of errors.

    Comment the below test case since the method createConnection() has a private access in com.baeldung.jwt.config.EmbeddedKeycloakRequestFilter.
    Ideally, private methods should not be tested directly, as they are normally used to implement the internal logic of the class and can be tested indirectly by testing public methods.
    However, if you still want to test private methods directly, you need to use Reflection APIs or change the access level of the method from private to a higher-access level (e.g., protected or public).
