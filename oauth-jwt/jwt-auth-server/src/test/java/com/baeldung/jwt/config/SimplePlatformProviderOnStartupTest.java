================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Potential Arbitrary Code Execution
Issue: If an attacker is able to control the Runnable passed to the onStartup method, they could execute arbitrary code within the context of your program.
Solution: Limit the exposure of the onStartup method and ensure strict control of Runnable objects passed to the method. This reduces the chance for unexpected code execution.

Vulnerability: Use of Dependent Libraries
Issue: Potential vulnerabilities can be introduced from dependent libraries such as keycloak. These are often outside the control of the code and can manifest as security issues.
Solution: Regularly update libraries and dependencies to their latest secure versions. Follow security announcements from the library maintainers.

Vulnerability: Potential Path Traversal Attack
Issue: The use of File object can potentially lead to a path traversal attack if the entry of the file path is not properly controlled and validated.
Solution: Ensure proper validation and sanitization of all file paths. Do not allow user controlled data to dictate file paths.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Startup Hook Test

Details:  
  TestName: validStartupHookTest.
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the given startupHook runs properly without error.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a Runnable startupHook object.
    Act: Invoke the onStartup method with the Runnable startupHook as a parameter.
    Assert: There would be no assertion in this scenario because the method does not return a result.
  Validation: 
    The execution of the method without any exception or error indicates correct behavior. This test validates that the application can successfully invoke any given startupHooks.

Scenario 2: Null Startup Hook Test

Details:  
  TestName: nullStartupHookTest.
  Description: This test checks what happens when a null startupHook is passed to the onStartup method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a Runnable startupHook as null.
    Act: Invoke the onStartup method with the null startupHook as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that a NullPointException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test validates the method's behavior when handling null inputs. Given that the method invokes `run()` on the input directly, it should throw a NullPointException when the input is null.

Scenario 3: Execution Flow of Startup Hook Test

Details:  
  TestName: executionFlowStartupHookTest.
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the defined behavior/procedure in Runnable startupHook executes in the correct sequence. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a startupHook to modify a boolean flag when run.
    Act: Run the onStartup method with the created startupHook and monitor the flag's value.
    Assert: Assert that the boolean flag's value is true.
  Validation: 
    This test validates that whatever behavior is defined in the provided startupHook Runnable object executes correctly when the onStartup method is called.
    
Scenario 4: Multiple Startup Hooks Test

Details:  
  TestName: multipleStartupHooksTest.
  Description: This test checks if the startupHook behaves appropriately when multiple startupHooks were setup and executed in sequence.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up multiple Runnable startupHook objects modifying a shared resource.
    Act: Invoke the onStartup method with each of these startupHooks in sequence.
    Assert: Assert the state of the shared resource after all startupHooks have been executed.
  Validation: 
    This test validates the application's ability to handle multiple startupHooks without impacting the overall functionality of the application.
