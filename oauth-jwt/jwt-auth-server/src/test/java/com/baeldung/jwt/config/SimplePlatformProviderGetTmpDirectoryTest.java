================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CVE-2020-14583
Issue: Insecure usage of 'java.io.tmpdir' can lead to security vulnerabilities. Malicious users can potentially read, modify, or delete any files written to this directory.
Solution: Avoid using 'java.io.tmpdir'. If temporary files are necessary, consider using the 'java.nio.file' package to create secure temporary directories and files. Always clean up any temporary files you created after they are no longer necessary.

Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: Exposing the method 'getTmpDirectory' publicly could allow an attacker to tamper with the application's temporary data.
Solution: Consider reducing the visibility of 'getTmpDirectory' to private, or ensure the output of this function is used in a safe manner. Utilize proper access control and defensive programming techniques to mitigate risk.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: Exposure of system level information like 'java.io.tmpdir' may lead to information disclosure that could aid an attacker with ill intent.
Solution: Avoidance of unnecessary system information exposure is recommended. If such a file location is needed, consider configuring it through secure environment variables or a secure configuration that is not exposed.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Temporary Directory Path Test

Details:  
  TestName: testValidTempDirectoryPath.
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the getTmpDirectory method properly returns a File object representation of the systems temporary directory path.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No preparation is necessary as this method does not depend on any input parameters or require any specific setup.
    Act: Call the getTmpDirectory method without any parameters.
    Assert: Check if the returned File object, when converted to a string, equals the system's temporary directory path ("java.io.tmpdir").
  Validation: 
    This assertion confirms that the getTmpDirectory is reading the system's temporary directory property correctly and creating a File object accordingly. This is crucial for ensuring that temporary files are stored in the correct location during the application's operation.


Scenario 2: Creation of Temporary Directory Test

Details:  
  TestName: testTempDirectoryCreation.
  Description: This test intends to verify that the temporary directory path referred by getTmpDirectory method actually exists or can be created.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is necessary as the method does not depend on any input parameters or require any specific setup.
    Act: Invoke getTmpDirectory method without any parameters.
    Assert: Verify that the temporary directory path referred by the returned File object exists or can be created.
  Validation:  
    This assertion checks that the system property "java.io.tmpdir" correctly identifies a directory that actually exists or can be created. Thus, ensuring that the creation of temporary files will not be hindered during the application's operation.


Scenario 3: Readable and Writable Temporary Directory Test

Details:  
  TestName: testTempDirectoryReadWritePermissions.
  Description: This test is intended to check that the directory identified by getTmpDirectory method has the necessary permissions to read and write.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the method is input agnostic.
    Act: Invoke getTmpDirectory method with no parameters.
    Assert: Check if the temporary directory referred by the returned File object is both readable and writable.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the temporary directory path can be interacted with appropriately by the application. This is crucial for the preservation and functionality of any temporary files the application needs to create, read or modify.
