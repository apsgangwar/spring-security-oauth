================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) / CWE-639
Issue: By allowing direct assignment of username, it can lead to unauthorized access. Attackers can potentially manipulate the method call to modify the username leading to impersonation.
Solution: Put in place an authorization layer before accessing critical methods. Validate the input username and perform necessary checks to ascertain that the operation is being performed by a legitimate user.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Valid Username Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testValidUsername.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the setUsername method works correctly with valid input data.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid username.
    Act: Invoke the setUsername method, passing in the valid username.
    Assert: Use assertEquals to check that the username has been correctly set.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the username is set correctly when a valid username is provided. This test ensures that our basic and expected functionality works correctly.

  Scenario 2: Null Input Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testNullUsername.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the setUsername method behaves correctly when a null value is passed as the argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: N/A
    Act: Invoke the setUsername method, passing in null as the argument.
    Assert: Use assertEquals to check that the username is now null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the username is set to null when null is passed as an argument. This test is significant because it ensures that the setUsername method can handle null input gracefully.

  Scenario 3: Empty String Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testEmptyStringUsername.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the setUsername method behaves correctly when an empty string is passed as the username.
  Execution:
    Arrange: N/A
    Act: Invoke the setUsername method, passing an empty string as the argument.
    Assert: Use assertEquals to check that the username is now an empty string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the username is correctly set to an empty string when such is passed as an argument. This test ensures the setUsername method can handle any kind of string input, including empty strings.
  
  Scenario 4: Special Characters Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testSpecialCharactersUsername.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the setUsername method behaves correctly when a string containing special characters is passed as the username.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a username containing special characters.
    Act: Invoke the setUsername method, passing the special characters username as the argument.
    Assert: Use assertEquals to check that the username now contains the special characters.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the username correctly includes the special characters when such a string is passed as an argument. This test helps to ensure that the setUsername method can handle all kinds of string inputs.
