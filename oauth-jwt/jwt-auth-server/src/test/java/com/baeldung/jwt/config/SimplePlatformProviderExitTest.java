================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-390: Error Without Action
Issue: The 'exit' method prints a stack trace when it encounters an error, but it doesn't take any follow-up action. In production environments, this behavior can disclose sensitive information such as the application's internal workings, structure, or configuration details.
Solution: Instead of printing the stack trace to a user, consider logging the error and showing the user a generic error message. For sensitive operations, it's also a good practice to delay error messages to mitigate timing attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The 'exit' method calls ServicesLogger.LOGGER.fatal with an exception. If this log is accessible by users or does not handle sensitive information carefully, it may expose sensitive system or application information. The LOGGER message should not display sensitive information which can be exploited by malicious users.
Solution: Sanitize the information printed to logs or presented to users. Make sure sensitive information such as system details, configurations or user data is not mistakenly included in the logs. Anomaly and error detection systems can be used to keep track of and respond to abnormal behavior in a timely manner without revealing sensitive information.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Validating proper functioning of the 'exit' method when a throwable cause is present

Details:  
  TestName: testExitMethodWithThrowableCause
  Description: This test is meant to validate the 'exit' method's correct execution in the context of a throwable cause. It should log the passed cause as a fatal error and call the 'exit' function with 1 as parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Throwable cause.
  Act: Invoke the 'exit' method with the throwable cause as a parameter.
  Assert: Verify that 'ServicesLogger.LOGGER.fatal' was called with the correct cause and that 'exit(1)' was invoked.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the 'exit' method behaves as expected when provided with a valid throwable cause. It is important to check this to confirm that the method can successfully log fatal errors and properly call 'exit' with the correct parameter.

Scenario 2: Error handling in the 'exit' method when null is passed as a parameter

Details:  
  TestName: testExitMethodWithNullParameter
  Description: This test ensures that the 'exit' method behaves appropriately when a null Throwable cause is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass null as a parameter.
  Act: Invoke the 'exit' method.
  Assert: Confirm that 'ServicesLogger.LOGGER.fatal' was called with a null parameter and that the 'exit(1)' was invoked correctly.
Validation: 
  This test checks that the method can handle null inputs without crashing or behaving unpredictably. This is crucial for detecting potential null exceptions and ensuring the method's robustness.

Scenario 3: Validating re-entrant scenarios for the 'exit' method

Details:  
  TestName: testExitMethodInReentrantScenario
  Description: This test verifies the 'exit' method's ability to handle re-entrant scenarios. This is done by ensuring it can handle being called multiple times in quick succession.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple Throwable causes and pass them to the method consecutively.
  Act: Invoke the 'exit' method with different Throwable causes in quick succession.
  Assert: Check that 'ServicesLogger.LOGGER.fatal' was called correctly for each cause and that 'exit(1)' was invoked appropriately each time.
Validation: 
  This test assures that the 'exit' method can handle rapid, successive calls, an important aspect of concurrent programming where methods may be invoked from different threads at any time.
